# DAY 1 (PRINTING , DEBUGGING, STRING MANIPULATION AND VARIABLES)

# print("hello world") - output- hello world
# print("hello world\nhello world\nhello world") it will print together.No need to write seperate.

# CONCATENATION (means merging)

# print("hello" + "world") result- helloworld
# print("hello"+" "+"world") result- hello world


# commas
# print("hello","shihab") #output--> hello shihab (commas use for spacing)
# print("hello" " world")
# print("hello" " world")

# INPUT FUNCTION

# print("what is your name?")
# input("what is your name?") asking details from user..

# this line of code will take an input using the input() function

# print("hello " + input("what is your name?") +"!") output - what is your name - shihab
#                                                                 hello shihab


# variables
# name= "jack"
# print(name)

# name="shihab"
# print(name)

# for finding length of strings --use (len) f

# print(len(input("what is your name?")))


# ** i have just turned (line21 )to very,very short line into three very long lines.
# username =input("what is your name?")
# length= len(username)
# print(length)
# so i was confused that what is happening and what going to be output here
# ANS- i put the username as 'variable' and gave 'input' f. to print the length of the input from user. THATS SET.

# MY FIRST PRACTICE BY MYSELF
# one=input("what is your name?")
# print("ok "+ one + " !!")
# two=input("how are you!!")
# print("nice to hear ")
# three=input("So tell me your qualification..")
# print("Awesome")
# four=input("so what is goal by doing coding")
# print("Ok understood")
# five=input("how much coding knowledge you have")
# input("beginner"+" " "intermediate"+ " " "or" + " " "experience"+" " "Ans->")
# print("ok thats great"+"!!")

# NAMING VARIABLES
# Rules for variable names
# Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z)or underscore_
# can contain letters, numbers, and underscores only
# can't start with a number
# can't use python keywords like class, if else, for,etc.
# python is case-sensitive(Name not equalls to name)

# final project of this lesson

# BAND NAME GENERATOR

# print("Welcome to the band Name Generator.")

# lets1 = input("Whats the name of the city\n you grew up in"+" ""?")

# lets2=input("What's your pet's name?\n")
# print("your band could be:" + lets1 +" " + lets2)


# num="100"
# num= int(num)
# print(num + 50)


# name=input("what is your name? ")

# # say hello to user
# print("hello, "+ name)


# important


# print("hello"+"shihab") # adding 2 strings

# print("hello" " " "shihab") 
# print("hello " "shihab") 

# print("hello","shihab") # automatically python giving space 
# print("hello"+" " "shihab") #same as 1st one


# print("hello " + input("what is your name ?")+" !")


# how to find length
# username= input("what is your name :")
# length = len(username)
# print(length)


# print("i", "am", "learning", sep="-")
