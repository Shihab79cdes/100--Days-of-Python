# DATA TYPES, NUMBERS, OPERATIONS, TYPE CONVERSION, f-strings.


# subscripting (means to take the list of strings from their specific position) *it may be in positive form,
# by starting from 0,1,2,3etc. and in negative form (starting -1,-2,-3etc)

# print("shihab"[0])  #output -- 's'
# print ("shihab"[-1]) - output-- 'b'

# strings
# print("1230"+"234") #output - 1230234 (#this is concatenation it will just merge the numbers instead of "adding".)

# int (integers) = all whole numbers no matters positive or negetive are called integers in programming.
# print( 1230 + 234 ) output -1464 (#this will print the calculated number, as its not strings.)

# large numbers
# print(456123_789)  # by giving underscore. #output - 456123789

# Float = Floating Point Number (because it has a decimal place.)
# print(3.7987) #output--3.7987

# Bollean (it is most used data types in programming) *this value is always begin with capital T and F, and they dont have any quotation.
# print (True)
# print (False)


# Lets talk about more Data types and function
# Note 1. Len function not work with integers it will give type error
# len(6677) output-- it will show 'type error'

# For knowing data types (we use (type) function)
# print(type("shihab"))  #output - 'str' it means string data type.
# print(type(123))  #output - 'int'    it means integer data type.
# print(type(234.45)) #output - 'float'  data type is float.
# print(type(True)) #output - 'bool'  data type is bolean


# Now what if we aren't happy with the assigned data type ?
# If we want to convert a piece of data into a different data type?


# Than we would need to learn about something called 'TYPE CONVERSION' , also known as type casting.

# print("123" +"456") so this is a string
# what if For converting this string into integer.
# we can use one of the built-in functions called "int" for coverting into a number
# let see
# print(int("123")+ int("456")) #output- 579 (so this is the power of TYPE COVERSION)

# print("Number of letters in your name: "+len(input("Enter your name"))) #learn the type error what it means and solve it.
# lets see now.

# break kore bojano hoche

# name_of_the_user = input("enter your name")
# length_of_name =len(name_of_the_user)

# print("number of letters in your name: " + str(length_of_name))

# long e emon vabe
# print("Number of letters in your name: "+ str (len(input("Enter your name"))))


# a =23
# c=46
# print(str(a)+ "+" +str(c))


# MATHEMATICAL OPERATION IN PYTHON

# print(123+344) #additon
# print(123-344) #subtraction
# print(4*5)# multiply
# print(type(6/3)) #divide but the answer is coming in float.so for that
# print(6 // 3) #for removing decimal point. so use it carefully.
# print(2**3) #exponent the power is last digit.

# important

# subscripting mane holo square bracket diye kumo string/ list er index access kora.
# print("hello"[4])


# print(bool("1212") + bool("333"))


# SOLUTION

#  step 1
# üëâ Python e kono non-empty string always True hoy.


# bool("1212") ‚ûù True
# bool("333")  ‚ûù True


# Step 2: True + True
# Python e True = 1 and False = 0
# So:
# python
#
# True + True = 1 + 1 = 2

# step3
# print(bool("1212") + bool("333"))  # Output: 2


# name = input("what is your name?")

# print(f"hello,{name}")


# name = input("what is your name?")
# print("hello," + name)

# age = 12

# print(f"you are {age} years old")
